# Downscaling Land Surface Temprature
 
Using a 10-m NDVI map, a 1-km LST of Sentinel-3 SLSTR Level-2 is downscaled to 10-m LST map.
A random forest model is trained to model coarse scale LST to high resolution products.
The following diagram shows the workflow of downscaling 1-km LST to a 10-m product:
